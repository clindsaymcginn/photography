		<h3> Inspiration </h3>
		<p>I shared some of my favorite photographers that are more "under-the-radar", so I wanted to feature some famous photographers that inspire me. These are artists who have had successful careers as photographers. </p>

 				<td><h3 id="Nan"><a href="http://www.matthewmarks.com/new-york/artists/nan-goldin/">Nan Goldin</a></h3><p><em>Nancy "Nan" Goldin (born September 12, 1953) is an American photographer. She lives and works in New York City, Berlin, and Paris.</em> I first fell in love with Goldin's work sitting on a giant bean bag at the Walker Art Center watching <cite>The Ballad of Sexual Dependency</cite>, a slide show of Goldin's photographs set to a mystical rock and roll soundtrack. Her intensely intimate photographs of her friends in personal situation inspire me to shoot even when situations feels awkward or inappropriate.</p></td>

				<td><h3 id="wolf"><a href="http://photomichaelwolf.com/">Michael Wolf</a></h3><p><em>Michael Wolf (born 1954) is a German artist and photographer who lives and works in Hong Kong and Paris.</em> I found Wolf's photography online one day and I spent the next few hours looking through every image on his site. His <cite>Architecture of Density</cite> series makes me consider my place on planet earth, yep, they are that good. I highly recommend checking out his site.</p></td>

				<td><h3 id="joel"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Sternfeld">Joel Sternfeld</a></h3><p><em>Joel Sternfeld (born June 30, 1944) is a fine-art color photographer noted for his large-format documentary pictures of the United States and helping establish color photography as a respected artistic medium.</em> I came across Sternfeld's photography through his book, <cite>Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America</cite>, which I purchased because it featured a photo from the neighborhood that I grew up in. I love his scenic photos from across America.</p></td>
